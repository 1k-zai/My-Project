Question 2: How did you use the class and id attributes differently?
The id attribute was used to uniquely identify sections of the website such as home, about, and contact. These IDs allow navigation links to move users directly to specific sections of the webpage.

The class attribute was used to group multiple elements together that share similar styling or structure. For example, sections that have similar content formatting used the same class. This makes the website easier to organize and manage.

Question 3: Which attribute helped improve user experience the most and why?
The alt attribute on images improved user experience the most because it provides text descriptions if the image fails to load and helps visually impaired users using screen readers.

Other helpful attributes included:

placeholder – guides users on what to type in form fields.

controls – allows users to play videos and audio easily.

required – ensures users complete important form fields.

Question 4: Development Process
1. How did you plan your website structure before coding?
I first planned the website using a basic layout structure:

Header for navigation

Main content sections

Footer for copyright

I decided what content belongs in each section and ensured the layout followed semantic HTML structure.

2. What was your approach to testing and debugging your HTML?
I tested my website by:

Opening the file in a web browser.

Checking if navigation links worked correctly.

Ensuring forms and media elements displayed properly.

Checking for missing tags or syntax errors.

3. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
Some challenges included:

Remembering many HTML elements.

Making navigation links work correctly.

Ensuring all tags were properly closed.

I solved these by reviewing notes, checking examples, and testing frequently.

Question 5: Git & GitHub Implementation
1. What Git commands did you use during development?
I used:

git init – To create a repository

git add . – To add files

git commit -m "message" – To save changes

git push – To upload files to GitHub

git pull – To update files

2. How many commits did you make and what was your commit message strategy?
I made several commits during development. My commit strategy was to:

Commit after adding new sections.

Commit after fixing errors.

Clear used messages like:

“Added About Section”

“Created Contact Form”

“Fixed navigation links”

Question 6: Code Quality & Best Practices
1. How did you ensure your HTML was valid and error-free?
I ensured quality by:

Checking for missing closing tags.

Testing the website in a browser.

Following correct HTML structure rules.

2. What best practices did you follow for writing clean, readable code?
I followed best practices such as:

Using semantic HTML elements.

Indenting code properly.

Using meaningful element names.

Grouping related content logically.

3. How would you improve your website if you had more time?
If I had more time, I would:

Add CSS styling for better appearance.

Add JavaScript for interactivity.

Include animations and responsive design.

Add more pages and multimedia content.
